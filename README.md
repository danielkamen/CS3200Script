This repo contains the script used to parse the trail geodata and turn it into a csv file which can be entered into our group project as real data.

We also chose to access real elevation data (K18 folder) which was collected from here: https://viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfinderpanoramas_org3.htm

The trail geodata was collected form here: https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/

We have no intentions of passing public open sourced data as our own. Full credit to the crreators of both datasets.
